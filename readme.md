# Implementation Guide CH ATC

The profile CH ATC defines the audit trail consumption requirements for the EPR in Switzerland which a community has to provide for a patients audit trail.
This project builds an implementation guide with [IG Publisher](http://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=IG_Publisher_Documentation) from HL7. 
See [e-health-suisse.ch](https://www.e-health-suisse.ch/) for more information about the Electronic Patient Record in Switzerland.
